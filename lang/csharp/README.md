dotnet build
```

# To Test

cd test
dotnet test
```

# Design Considerations

### Document and IStorageProvider

The container for all IFC instances is the `Document`. A Document holds a reference to an implementation
of `IStorageProvider`. The built in storage provider is `LocalStorageProvider`, which provides an in-memory store, but
other implementations of `IStorageProvider` could be created which allow storage to disk or to a database.

### Generated Code

Most of the code in this repository is generated automatically
using [IFC-gen](https://github.com/hypar-io/IFC-gen/blob/master/README.md). The templates for code generation and
certain base classes have been designed to generate an idiomatic C# library.

- All EXPRESS `TYPE` have a corresponding class derived from `IfcType`, which is a wrapper class whose `Value` property
  holds the actual value.
- All EXPRESS `ENUM` have a corresponding enum.
- All EXPRESS collection types: 'LIST', 'SET', and 'ARRAY', currently generate `List<T>` fields in C#. This solution
  does not conform to the EXPRESS specification for those types. So it will be updated in the future.
- EXPRESS `SELECT` types are created as classes derived from the `Select` base class. The `Select` base class is a poor
  man's union type, containing a field called `Choice` of type `object`. Generated `SELECT` types, have as many
  constructors as there are types in the select, each of which simply sets the Choice object to the provided object.
  This is all to get around C#'s lack of a discriminated union type.
- All EXPRESS `ENTITY` have a corresponding class.
- All IFC attributes are generated as public class properties with a getter and setter. Chances are these will become
  more restrictive in the future. For those attributes not marked as `OPTIONAL`, the entity's corresponding class
  constructor will have parameters corresponding to the property, and a corresponding assignment will be generated in
  the constructor body.
- Attributes marked as `DERIVED` are not currently turned into properties. Although the grammar generates a parser which
  can understand `DERIVE` and `WHERE` statements, these are not currently converted to code in property or method
  bodies.
- Types derived from `IfcRelationship` do not have corresponding parameters in the generated constructors. Many types
  have _many_ relationship properties. Adding all of these to the constructor made the constructors unwieldy. It's
  possible that these are required, but my present intuition is that a higher-level factory class for properly
  generating entities and establishing their relationships is a better way to do this. Whether these higher level
  libraries can also be auto-generated is a point on which I welcome all feedback.
- EXPRESS `WHERE` statements do not currently generate code. One possible pattern for this would be to generate static
  constructors for classes, placing the data validation logic in the static constructor and throwing an exception if the
  data validation fails. But, I feel like data validation needs to be done whenever the state of the object changes, so
  these data validation methods should either be reactive to property value changes, or they should live in a separate
  class containing testing methods for validating objects of certain types.
- EXPRESS `FUNCTION` statements are not supported. Generating code for these functions would require math parsing
  functionality and per-language generation code for mathematical expressions.
